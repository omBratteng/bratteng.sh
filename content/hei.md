Heisann, thanks for checking the blog! I'm Ole-Martin, a software developer at [the National Archives of Norway](https://www.arkivverket.no/en).

If you happen to read this and find my posts interesting, just [let me know](https://twitter.com/omBratteng)! Will be happy to have a chat with you around a coffee ☕️ (or red wine 🍷?).
